### Toolkit I -- Flight design

Step (1) - Please download an aerial image for your study site, and this orthophoto needs to be orthogonized and georeferenced.

Step (2) - High-elev flight route:

Please delineate flight boundary and water surface boundary from aerial image.

Low-elev flight route:

Please delineate flight boundary, water surface boundary, trees, and buildings from aerial image. 

Step (3) Save the nodes of flight boundary and water surface boundary into a txt file, the format of txt file should be:

OBJECTID, X,  Y
